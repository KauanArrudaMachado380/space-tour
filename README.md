this project is a challenge to train skills in creating pages and applications, the project is part of a set that is available on the Frontend Mentor website (<https://www.frontendmentor.io/home>), all credits belong to them.

The project in question is a four-page website that allows us to go on a little adventure in space, showing some destinations, our crew and the technology we'll be using.
The project is responsive using MediaQuery and Mobile First, mainly using grid-layout to make the project look the way the challenge asked.

All the formatting settings were taken from the figma given in the challenge, and there may be some errors in the colors or styles because I don't have figma's Dev Mode.
